## Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze maternal health factors—including body composition, nutrition, and medical history—to identify patterns associated with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and related pregnancy outcomes. Through data visualization and predictive analytics, the goal is to support early risk detection and improve maternal and neonatal health outcomes.

## Project Overview
## Gestational Diabetes & Maternal Health

This Power BI project provides an in-depth analysis of maternal and gestational health using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive dashboards. It integrates patient history, maternal fat ultrasound data, skinfold thickness, newborn parameters, and predictive analytics to uncover clinical insights and support data-driven healthcare decisions.

## Key Reports

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Summary statistics, trend visualizations, and distribution insights.

###  Patient History Overview:
 Demographics, medical background, and pregnancy risk profiles.

###  Diabetes Mellitus Reports:
 Analysis of DM Reported, Disease Gap, and Gestational Diabetes cases.

### Maternal Fat & Skinfold Thickness: 
Evaluates body composition and its impact on gestational outcomes.

### Newborn Analysis:
 Examines birth weight, gestational age, and maternal health correlation.

### Predictive Analytics Dashboard: 
Identifies early indicators of gestational risk and outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies

Power BI (Power Query, DAX, Report Design), PostgreSQL , Excel 

### Results & Findings

 Positive correlation observed between maternal fat measurements and gestational diabetes occurrence.

 Higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) associated with increased maternal health risk.

 Skinfold thickness demonstrated strong predictive value for identifying potential complications.

 Newborn outcomes (birth weight and gestational age) showed dependency on maternal nutritional assessment.

 Predictive analytics model improved understanding of early risk indicators, enabling data-driven prenatal interventions.
